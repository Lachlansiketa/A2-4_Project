								<b><big>Machine Learning
What does it do?
</big></b>
										<br>
										Machine learning is a sub section of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems to automatically learn and improve experience. Machine learning will access data and use it to learn for the development of a computer program.[1]
										<br>
										<br>
										<b>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </b>
										<br>
                                        <br>
										
											• Supervised Learning
                                            <br>
										<br>
By exposing a system to large amounts of labelled data supervised learning can create a dataset for the predictions about the output values. Feeding in images of a blue cars so the algorithm can identify a blue car for example.
<br>
										<br>
	• Un-Supervised Learning
    <br>
										<br>
Using non-labelled data unsupervised learning can discover patterns from datasets. Identifying similarities in data to put into a category which can then be used later on.
<br>
										<br>
	• Semi-Supervised Learning
    <br>
										<br>
A combination of both supervised and unsupervised using both labelled and non-labelled data for training. Usually this method can improve learning accuracy.
<br>
										<br>
	• Reinforcement Learning
    <br>
										<br>
This method will interact with its environment using actions and discovering errors or rewards. This method can produce ideal behaviors through a software agent within a specific context.[3]

									<b><big>What can be done now? </big></b>
										<br>
                                        <br>
											• Image, text and video recognition
 <br>
                                        <br>                                           
With the increase of computing power and knowledge of AI and Machine Learning we are now getting to a point in the technology where recognition software is becoming very accurate and efficient. This gives us a greater use for the software in different applications, whether it’s for images, text, voice or video.
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Cybersecurity (Anti-Virus, Malware)
    <br>
                                        <br>
Most modern security software packages are employing AI/Machine learning algorithms to help detect, block and remove malware, virus, spyware and intrusions.
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Medical diagnosis (Detection of Cancer)
    <br>
                                        <br>
Machine learning is now being used in the Medical field to help diagnose patients with the help of human Doctors, the AI is about 4% behind an actual person making the diagnosis but with the AI and human doctor working together they have an error rate of 0.5% for cancer detection.[3]
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Digital Assistants (Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant)
    <br>
                                        <br>
Using machine learning digital assistants and learn your behaviors and patterns and tailor different services towards you personally. The more time you spend using the digital assistant the more in tune to what you usually request.
<br>
                                        <br>
	• Fraud Detection
    <br>
                                        <br>
Using specific algorithms, machine learning can used to determine the difference between authorized and fraudulent transactions.[4]


										<b><big>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?  </big></b>
                                          <br>
                                        <br>
						• Self-Driving cars and Automated Transportation
                          <br>
                                        <br>
With the rise in AI and machine learning we are very close to having fully automated vehicles on our roads.
The rapid increase in machine learning for navigation (Google Maps) and using sensors to avoid objects, this have already resulted in these vehicles performing more safely than a human driver.
This isn’t just for cars, already Boeing 777 pilots spend just seven minutes actually flying, the rest of the work is taken care of by the AI.[5]				<br><br>

										<b><big>What technological or other developments make this possible?</big></b>
										<br>
									<b>The technology that currently makes Cyber security possible is the likes of: </b>
										<br>
										- Cameras (Infrared, Night-vision, etc)
										<br>
										- Tool-based security (Anti-Malware, Spam detectors, etc)
										<br>
										- Programming and programmers dedicated to cyber security
										<br><br>
									<b>The technology that is being implemented into cyber security measures now are:</b>
										<br>
										- AI and Machine Learning (Monster Mind, etc
										<br>
										- Cloud based security measures (Security Assertion Markup Language, etc
										<br>
										- NetAPT (Software for mapping control system pathways)

      <div class="block"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>What is the likely impact? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>What is the potential impact of this development?</big></b>
										<br>
										The world is more technologically reliant than ever before. The impact on the advancement in technology is undeniable and advancing at faster rate than anyone could have anticipated.
										<br><br>
										Cyber Attacks are estimated to occur 2244 times per day as of this current year 2020.Cyber security acts as the only measure to prevent online fraud and helps in risk management. This has tremendous impacts on society such as anxiety, loss of confidence in technology, financial loss, stress, loss of reputation for a business, massive fines can occur if business get caught out.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What is likely to change</big></b>
										<br>
										Already more and more companies are switching to virtual desktops. COVID 19 has also had an impact as this year has seen a massive boom in remote workers operating outside of the safety of a corporate network.
										<br><br>
										Currently what is mostly used by business is two-factor authentication. Now with more workers working from home with this expecting to continue as a new way of live. The employees of organisations are now being targeted to gain access. We have already seen a rise in biometric authentication, and this is expected to rise. Biometric authentication is fingerprint. Thumbprint retina, iris, voice, or other facial recognition technology.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>Which people will be most affected and how?</big></b>
										<br>
										I think businesses will most effected and those in the company's cyber security roles. Cyber security is a massive topic to cover as there are many, many various technologies that go into it. Machine learning and artificial intelligence has made companies cyber security more effective and successful. However, with machine learning and artificial intelligence breaking into computers and systems has also become so easy. Companies in the past has spent a lot of effort, resources and money figuring out their organisations network topography. With the use of AI expediting this process by observing and learning network traffic patterns and recommending security policies this elevates a lot of the above and allows a company to use its people in more productive areas.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</big></b>
										<br>
										Now that cybercrime have begun using AI as part of their attack strategies, it's become imperative that businesses and individuals stay one step ahead. human analysts will no longer be able to fend off on their own against the extremely sophisticated attacks.
										<br>
										The Printing and publishing industry already have seen a massive declined and in the next 10 years expected to be non-existent.
										<br>
										Cashiers at supermarkets, banks etc. We have once again seen a massive decrease in this type of work with the likes of self-serve checkouts. And once again due to COVID 19 changing the world as we know it has also speed things up due to not wanting human contact due to the risk of contracting the virus.

      <div class="block last"><h1 style=color:black;><big><b>How will this affect you? </big></b></h1>
        <section>
								<b><big>How will this affect you daily?</big></b>
										<br>
										Artificial intelligence makes our lives more efficient. AI powers many programs and services that help us do everyday things like connecting with friends, using an email program or even taking a uber like ride share service.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>What will be different for you?</b></big>
										<br>
										Last year I had $1000 transferred to account without my authority. I did not know the receiver nor authorize this amount. The bank or the police were not able to do anything. Because of experiencing being hacked myself. I looked at all the situations that could improve my security. I often used the same passwords for multiple accounts. The passwords I did have where somewhat basic as I never had taken cybercrime seriously, now I also do not look on untrustworthy websites. I updated my phone, so I must unlock it with my face or passcode, and I also updated my laptop to start requiring my fingerprint on start-up.
										<br><br>
								<b><big>How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</big></b>
										<br>
										One of my friends started his own painting company about 1-2 years ago. He not only works with a lot of private customers but also with other companies enlisting his services. He completed work for one company and sent them an invoice. He began chasing the company for payment only to be told he had already been paid. He checked bank through his bank statements and could not find payment. The business provided proof that the payment had been made. What had happened was a hacker changed the bank details on the top the invoice sent by my friend and the company paid into the incorrect account by no fault of their own. 6 months later my friend has not been able to get back what he is owed. He has now implemented a third-party cyber security company to prevent any data breaches again.
